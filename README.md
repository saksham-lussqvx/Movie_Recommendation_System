# Movie_Recommendation_System
As always, this is special because of some small yet distinguishable tweaks! I have added two completely new things in it. This has first of all some moving animation and one more  features it comes wrapped with is 'About us', which is a simple function used to show more about movie through either a poster or a wikipedia link. This program is able to recommend movies easily and requires some files to run so make sure to put all files in the same folder only!
